# Imbalanced SNP detection

04.28.2020 Risa KK.

## Scripts

* Data exploring and conversion
  * simple_binom_pair_sim.ipynb
    * -> compute correlation between 1-2 and 1-3 time points
  * simple_binom_sim.ipynb
    * discarded
* Empirical p-value computation
  * comp_obs_and_emp_p.r
    * -> estimate a background p for binomial and simulate 10000 times
* Visualization
  * analyze_model_pvalue.r
  * -> 



## Workflow

* Make rds files by simple_binom*_sim.ipynb
  * simple_independent...
    * estimate a background p independently
  * simple_t0_independent...
    * estimate a background p from t=0
  * These are my first trial and computed p is not used for the later analysis
  * Instead, correlation and basic information (read counts) are used
* Compute empirical p-values
  * remove SNPs on X scaffolds
  * 
* Integrate and visualize the results
  * remove SNPs (ASE < 0.9 and minor allele read coverage > 10)
