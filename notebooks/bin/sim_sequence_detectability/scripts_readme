## Contents
* FPR TPR quad
The pairs of FPR and TPR are obtained from the p-value vector and true/negative answer vector for all SNPs using roc function in R. They should contain 100 ROC curves for each quad.
At the bottom of simulate_min_cov_snp.r, you can run the program to draw ROC curves.
If the flag on line 213 is true, it can compute ROC curves. Otherwise, it draws ROC curves via a function plot.auroc.only.
A function plot.smooth.roc.data contains the actual drawing process, in which FPR values are binned to 10 bins and average TPR is used for the y coordinate.
